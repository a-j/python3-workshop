# Installing Python and VS Code

Before we get started learning Python, the first thing we need to do is set up our machines both with the Python language and some tools to interact with it.

First, we'll install the Python interpreter for our operating system. Then, we'll install VS Code, a code editor that will help us write Python code.  

## Installing Python on Your Machine

There are different ways to install Python interpreter on our machines. It's possible you have already attempted to install Python, or it might have already come with your computer. In order to make sure the rest of the tutorial is helpful, here are some instructions to make sure you install it in a way that the rest of this guide expects.

Open up the instructions for your operating system in a new tab and follow along with them:

- [Windows](/installation/windows-installation.md)
- [Mac](/installation/mac-installation.md)
- [Linux](/installation/linux-installation.md)

When you're done following the instructions for your operating sytem, you can go ahead and move on to the next step!

## Installing VS Code on Your Machine

VS Code is a free code editor which runs on MacOS, Linux and Windows. You can get started installing VS code by following the instructions for your operating system [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).

Please complete the following sections of the VS Code installation process above depending on your operating system:

**Mac**
- "Installation"
- "Launching from the command line"

**Linux** 
- "Installation"
- "Setting VS Code as the default text editor"
- If you do not have `snap` on your system then follow the instructions listed for your Linux distribution

**Windows**
- "Installation"
- When you run the setup process look for checkboxes on the "Select Additional Tasks" step. You'll want to check all of those checkboxes off so that VS code can help you edit your files more easily.

### Installing the VS Code Python Extension 

After VS Code is installed we can add a VS Code extension to help us code with Python. To do this you can visit [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and press "Install" that should prompt VS Code to load the correct extension for you to install.

If that doesn't work, you can also search for the extension from inside of VS Code by clicking the square-looking symbol below the crossed out bug icon on the left menu.

From there, you can search for "Python" and install the Python extension that comes up. After clicking on it you should see "ms-python.python" next to the name. It should also have over 44 million installs.

With this taken care of, you're ready to begin learning Python with one of the most popular development tools out there!
