# A Complete Beginner's Introduction to Python

## Part 1

With Python v3.7.4 and VS Code installed we can get stardted learning Python!

As you go through this guide, you will see different sections that look like this:

`my_name = "Fernando"`

You'll similar fonts to this throughout the internet. That sort of style indicates that it is code of some sort. In this particular guide, it will usually reference Python code that we can enter into the Python interpreter.

So, with the above example you could enter type this line in at the >>> prompt in your Python shell. Simply enter the line, hit Return or Enter after every line you enter, and note the output (although sometimes there won’t be any!).

Tip: Don’t copy and paste commands – type them out. You’ll learn far more if you take the time to type everything yourself.
